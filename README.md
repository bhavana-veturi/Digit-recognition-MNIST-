# Digit recognition for the MNIST dataset
Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks in Python with Keras
The MNIST problem is a dataset developed by Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes and Christopher Burges for evaluating machine learning models on the handwritten digit classification problem.
A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. Using CNN features availible in keras and using ADAM gradient descent, we aim to accuratly predict the digit present in the image.
